Q:
Why is depth-limited minimax sometimes preferable to minimax without a depth limit?

Depth-limited minimax can arrive at a decision more quickly because it explores fewer states **answer**
Depth-limited minimax will achieve the same output as minimax without a depth limit, but can sometimes use less memory
Depth-limited minimax can make a more optimal decision by not exploring states known to be suboptimal
Depth-limited minimax is never preferable to minimax without a depth limit

Ans:
Purpose of putting depth limit to minimax is to make the searching time viable enough for very large state spaces.
In a game like tictactoe, it would not be needed but in a game like chess, it would be avoidable not to use it.
