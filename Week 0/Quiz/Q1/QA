Q:
Between depth first search (DFS) and breadth first search (BFS), which will find a shorter path through a maze?

DFS will always find a shorter path than BFS
BFS will always find a shorter path than DFS
DFS will sometimes, but not always, find a shorter path than BFS
BFS will sometimes, but not always, find a shorter path than DFS *answer*
Both algorithms will always find paths of the same length

Ans:
BFS searches with a layer by layer approach where the search can not step into the tiles in next layer without finishing the current layer(BFS Logic.png).
This ensures that the first path found to the target is the shortest path.DFS however searches till a deadend and tries other possibilities 
till it finds a correct path,and this approach does not ensure that the first path found from source to target is the shortest one(DFS Logic.png).
