Q:
Between depth first search (DFS) and breadth first search (BFS), which will find a shorter path through a maze?

DFS will always find a shorter path than BFS
BFS will always find a shorter path than DFS
DFS will sometimes, but not always, find a shorter path than BFS
BFS will sometimes, but not always, find a shorter path than DFS
Both algorithms will always find paths of the same length

Ans:
BFS searches with a layer by layer approach where every
