Q:(q0q4.png)
What is the value of the root node?

Ans:
Red player chooses between options to minimize the score while green one to maximize it.
So after red ones chose we would have (green1,empty)((red1,5),(red2,1),(red3,2))
And after that the green1 or the root one would choose the maximum which would be 5.
