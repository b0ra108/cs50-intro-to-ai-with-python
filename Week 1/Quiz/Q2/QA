Q:
There are other logical connectives that exist, other than the ones discussed in lecture. 
One of the most common is “Exclusive Or” (represented using the symbol ⊕). The expression 
A ⊕ B represents the sentence “A or B, but not both.” 

Which of the following is logically equivalent to A ⊕ B?

(A ∨ B) ∧ ¬ (A ∧ B) **answer**
(A ∧ B) ∨ ¬ (A ∨ B)
(A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∧ B)
(A ∨ B) ∧ ¬ (A ∨ B) 

Ans:
Exclusive Or(⊕) is same as normal Or(V) in terms of outputs they give, except that exclusive or gives false when
both of the statements are true.So our statement for A ⊕ B should include (A V B) and another
statement in addition that makes the final statement false when both A and B is true,but at the same time
this other statement should not effect the result of other cases for (A V B).

We want this statement to have a distinct results when both of the symbols are true,so that we can
effect the result only when both of the symbols are true.Such statements can be either (A ∧ B) or (¬A V ¬B).
Also,statement we choose should be connected to (A V B) with an ∧, because we want to affect
the result when both A and B is true.

Considering these: Answer is (A ∨ B) ∧ (¬A V ¬B),equivalently (A ∨ B) ∧ ¬(A ∧ B)
