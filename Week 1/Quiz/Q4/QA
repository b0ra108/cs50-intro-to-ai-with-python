Q:
Consider, in first-order logic, the following predicate symbols. Student(x) represents the predicate that “x is a student.” 
Course(x) represents the predicate that “x is a course.” Enrolled(x, y) represents the predicate that “x is enrolled in y.” 
Which of the following is a first-order logic translation of the sentence “There is a course that Harry and Hermione are both enrolled in.”?

∃x. Course(x) ∧ Enrolled(Harry, x) ∧ Enrolled(Hermione, x) **answer**
∀x. Course(x) ∧ Enrolled(Harry, x) ∧ Enrolled(Hermione, x)
∃x. Enrolled(Harry, x) ∧ ∃y. Enrolled(Hermione, y)
∀x. Enrolled(Harry, x) ∧ ∀y. Enrolled(Hermione, y)
∃x. Enrolled(Harry, x) ∨ Enrolled(Hermione, x)
∀x. Enrolled(Harry, x) ∨ Enrolled(Hermione, x)

Intuition:
"There is a" statement means that such course does exist, which implies that we are going to use "existential" symbol in our statement.
The statements other than the first two does not even check if x is a course, and second statement uses "all" symbol which is incorrect.
So this leaves us with answer Course(x) ∧ Enrolled(Harry, x) ∧ Enrolled(Hermione, x) as the suitable one.
