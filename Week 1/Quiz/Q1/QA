Which of the following logical entailments is true?

a.Sentence 6 entails Sentence 2
b.Sentence 1 entails Sentence 4
c.Sentence 6 entails Sentence 3
d.Sentence 2 entails Sentence 5 **answer**
e.Sentence 1 entails Sentence 2
f.Sentence 5 entails Sentence 6

Ans:
According to definition of entailment, if A entails B where A and B might be any propositional logic statement,
if A is true then B must be true as well for all the models (all the possiblities of symbols used in A and B).

a.(Ron V Hermione) entails Hermione, is not true since Ron = true,Hermione = false does not satisfy the entailment condition
b.(Hermione --> Harry) entails Harry, is not true since Hermione = false,Harry = false does not satisfy the entailment condition
c.(Ron V Hermione) entails (Ron ⋀ ⌐Ron), is not true since (Ron ⋀ ⌐Ron) is false regardless
d.Hermione --> (⌐Harry V Hermione), is true since it satisfies the entailment condition which for all the possibilities of Hermione and Harry,
(⌐Harry V Hermione) is true when Hermione is true
e.(Hermione --> Harry) entails Hermione, is not true since Hermione = false does not satisfy the entailment condition
f.(⌐Harry V Hermione) entails (Ron V Hermione), is not true since Harry = false, Hermione = false, Ron = false does not satisfy the entailment condition
