Q:
Let propositional variable R be that “It is raining,” the variable C be that “It is cloudy,” and the variable S be that “It is sunny.” 
Which of the following a propositional logic representation of the sentence “If it is raining, then it is cloudy and not sunny.”?

(R → C) ∧ ¬S
R → C → ¬S
R ∧ C ∧ ¬S
R → (C ∧ ¬S) **answer**
(C ∨ ¬S) → R

Ans:
By intuition, if statement brings an "implication" bell, and the rest of the statement is an "and" statement.
So, R --> (C ⋀ ⌐S) is suitable.
